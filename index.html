          <strong>BEST ONLINE SHOPPING SITE IN INDIA FOR FASHION</strong>
          <p>
            Be it clothing, footwear or accessories, Myntra offers you the ideal
            combination of fashion and functionality for men, women and kids. You
            will realise that the sky is the limit when it comes to the types of
            outfits that you can purchase for different occasions.
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Smart men’s clothing</strong> - At Myntra you will find myriad options in smart formal shirts and
              trousers, cool T-shirts and jeans, or kurta and pyjama combinations for men. Wear your attitude with printed
              T-shirts. Create the back-to-campus vibe with varsity T-shirts and distressed jeans. Be it gingham, buffalo,
              or window-pane style, checked shirts are unbeatably smart. Team them up with chinos, cuffed jeans or cropped
              trousers for a smart casual look. Opt for a stylish layered look with biker jackets. Head out in cloudy
              weather with courage in water-resistant jackets. Browse through our innerwear section to find supportive
              garments which would keep you confident in any outfit.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Trendy women’s clothing</strong> - Online shopping for women at Myntra is a mood-elevating
              experience. Look hip and stay comfortable with chinos and printed shorts this summer. Look hot on your date
              dressed in a little black dress, or opt for red dresses for a sassy vibe. Striped dresses and T-shirts
              represent the classic spirit of nautical fashion. Choose your favourites from among Bardot, off-shoulder,
              shirt-style, blouson, embroidered and peplum tops, to name a few. Team them up with skinny-fit jeans, skirts
              or palazzos. Kurtis and jeans make the perfect fusion-wear combination for the cool urbanite. Our grand sarees
              and lehenga-choli selections are perfect to make an impression at big social events such as weddings. Our
              salwar-kameez sets, kurtas and Patiala suits make comfortable options for regular wear.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Fashionable footwear</strong> - While clothes maketh the man, the type of footwear you wear reflects
              your personality. We bring you an exhaustive lineup of options in casual shoes for men, such as sneakers and
              loafers. Make a power statement at work dressed in brogues and oxfords. Practice for your marathon with
